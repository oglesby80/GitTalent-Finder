Candidate Search and Save Application
This project is a React-based web application for searching GitHub users and saving potential candidates. It provides two main features:

Candidate Search: Browse random GitHub users and view their profile details.
Saved Candidates: Keep a list of potential candidates you've saved for future reference.
Features
GitHub User Search: The app fetches random GitHub user profiles, displaying essential information like their name, location, email, company, and bio.
Save Candidates: You can save a candidate you’re interested in by clicking the save button.
Skip Candidates: Skip users that you’re not interested in to view new suggestions.
Saved Candidates Management: View a list of all saved candidates with options to view their full GitHub profile or remove them from the list.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Vite: As the build tool for a fast development environment.
TypeScript: For type safety and better developer experience.
React Router: For navigation between different pages within the app.
CSS: Custom styling for the entire UI.

Potential Issues and Solutions
GitHub API Token Issues:

Ensure that your GitHub token is correctly added to .env and has the right permissions.
Check the browser console for any 401 Unauthorized errors to confirm if the token is valid.
Incomplete Data:

Some fields (e.g., location, company, email) may not always be provided by GitHub users, hence they may display as "N/A".
